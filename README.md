# 🎮 EasyMCServer

### Create and manage a Minecraft server in minutes — no technical knowledge required.

Setting up a Minecraft server with Hamachi is usually painful:
config files, EULA errors, Java issues, broken servers…

**EasyMCServer fixes all of that.**

Just open the app, choose your version, enter your Hamachi IP —  
and your server is ready.
